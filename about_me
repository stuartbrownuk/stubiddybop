Hello world!  My name is Stuart Brown, and my nickname for online activities is StuBiddyBop

I write and produce my own music, and record and mix music for others too.  I have worked with Bands, Opera Singers, TV voiceover artists, made a little film music and lots of other projects.

I love the journey of discovery the most.  I love to tinker and experiment, and develop my understanding of sound.
